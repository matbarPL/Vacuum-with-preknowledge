# Vacuum-with-preknowledge
Intelligent agent whose task is to visit all fields of the board. 
The agent has prior knowledge of the obstacles positions and a size of the board. 
I used graph to represent possible moves from each state. 
I propose new algorithm in which every field of the board has priority. 
Thanks to that this algorithm performs better than standard BFS or DFS traversal algorithms. 

Additional features:

-saving gifs with the graph and the board traversal

-progressbar
